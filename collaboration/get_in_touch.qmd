I like to work collaboratively! So, feel free to reach out to me and we can
discuss the possibility of working together. In order to make such collaboration
easy for everyone, I have prepared various materials for you. 🌟

## Contact me 📬

Do you have a question? Do you want to set up a meeting? The easiest way to
contact me is to hit me up via an email to **ondrej.mottl(at)gmail.com**📧.
Also, feel free to reach out to me via
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ondrejmottl.bsky.social)!🦋

## Collaboration guide 🤝

Everyone has their own way of working and pace. In order to make collaboration
easy for everyone, I have prepared a [collaboration
guide](/collaboration/collaboration_guide.qmd) for you. It contains all the
information to make sure that there are no unpleasant surprises and that doing
science is as much fun as possible for everyone. 📚🌱

## Code convention 💻

My work is heavily focused on writing code. For this reason, I have prepared a
[code convention](/collaboration/code_convention.qmd), which I am following in
my projects. I am making it publically available so feel free to check it
out!💡📝

Feel free to explore these resources, and let's create something amazing
together! 🌟🌍🔬
