    "text": "GitHub\nSince my primary research involves writing code, GitHub is an essential platform for any collaborative work. Check out the overview of GitHub features to get familiar with its capabilities.\nI love leveraging its features, such as Issues, Pull Requests, and Projects, to streamline our collaborative coding efforts. If you are not familiar with GitHub, don‚Äôt worry! I can provide guidance and support to help you get started. It‚Äôs worth checking out their documentation for more details.\nHere is my basic GitHub workflow:\n\n\n\n\nflowchart\n    1[\"Make an Issue\"] --&gt; 2(\"Create a new branch\")\n    2 --&gt; 351471[\"Commit code\"]\n    351471 --&gt; 257387[\"Create Pull Request\"]\n    949464{{\"Does it need a review?\"}} --&gt; 625480([\"Yes\"])\n    949464 --&gt; 564859([\"No\"])\n    625480 --&gt; 752396[\"Assign reviewer\"]\n    564859 --&gt; 715681[\"Squash merge PR\"]\n    752396 --&gt; 715681\n    257387 --&gt; 385770[\"Link the Issue\"]\n    715681 --&gt; 688855(\"Close issue (if needed)\")\n    688855 --&gt; 791180[\"Delete the branch\"]\n    385770 --&gt; 515426(\"Add to Project (if &lt;span&gt;applicable&lt;/span&gt;)\")\n    515426 --&gt; 949464\n    791180 -.-&gt;|\"repeat\"| 2\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the individual steps in detail:\n\n1. Issues\nAn Issue represents a single task that needs to be addressed.\nEach Issue provides a platform to communicate the task with a description and the possibility to discuss details using comments. An Issue should be related to a specific problem or task. If a task is too complex or large, the Issue can be divided into several smaller ones and linked using task lists.\nFor more details about Issues, refer to the GitHub documentation.\n\n\n2. Branches\nFor any code change, a new branch should be created.\nEach branch should correspond to a specific task (Issue). Therefore, a branch should be named to describe the problem it is solving or directly as issue[Issue number]. If you find that the problem is too complex and needs to be split into multiple Issues or branches, you can create another branch from the current one. Branches are lightweight, so don‚Äôt worry about creating many of them.\nFor more details about branches, refer to the GitHub documentation.\n\n\n3. Writing code\nPlease follow the code conventions when writing code. Commit often but make sure to keep the description for each commit meaningful.\n\n\n4. Pull Request (PR)\nA Pull Request is a way to merge a branch into the main branch (or another branch). The PR name should clearly indicate the purpose of the changes.\nThe PR details should provide an explanation of the main modifications. Additionally, you can add comments to provide further context. If possible, create the PR as a ‚Äúdraft‚Äù until it is ready for review and merge (learn more about drafts).\nAs PRs are linked to branches, and each branch should be linked to an Issue, I prefer to use the ‚Äúlink‚Äù functionality explicitly. This can be achieved by mentioning the Issue with specific words (e.g., close) in the PR description (see more about linking).\nIf you want me to review your PR before merging, simply ‚Äúassign‚Äù it to me (learn more about assigning).\nI prefer to merge Pull Requests using the ‚Äúsquash merge commit‚Äù option (learn more about it here) for a cleaner git history.\n\n\n5. Projects\nGitHub Projects offer a new way of project management. If we agree to use a Project in our collaboration, we will define how to collaborate individually within that project framework."

By declaring paths in the configuration file that are utilized across multiple scripts, the user can simply refer to them by their variable name in the scripts.

Life scientists need to be able to predict biodiversity and ecosystem alteration under global climate change. However, scenarios able to predict biodiversity trajectories are wishful thinking as biotic interactions in novel environments or among newly coexisting species are not sufficiently understood. By investigating local processes of species interactions, BIODYNAMICS will contribute crucial insights into how these interactions shape continental and global biodiversity patterns over the past 20 thousand years (ka). BIODYNAMICS will develop innovative approaches that allow estimating ecosystem functioning, especially the essential biotic interactions, at 3 major ecological scales (spatial, temporal, and taxonomic), spanning from individual plants in local sites to whole continents and from 20 ka to the present.\nIt will do so using a newly compiled publicly available multidisciplinary database that integrates present and past global vegetation records with their functional traits and climate data. This database will serve as a valuable resource for advancing knowledge in eco-informatics, community ecology, climatology, and paleo- and neo-ecology.\nA key aspect of BIODYNAMICS is to utilize insights from the past to inform future predictions of global biodiversity patterns, which are anticipated to be influenced by anthropogenic climate change. By fostering interdisciplinary cooperation between these scientific disciplines, the project aims to enhance our understanding and quantification of biotic interactions in both historical and contemporary contexts. These insights will be instrumental in predicting ecological responses to global change, thereby ensuring the preservation of ecosystem services that are essential for our society.",

Our research spans spatio-temporal scales, investigating both historical and contemporary factors that shape ecological patterns of ecosystems.\n\nResearch Focus\nDelving into various facets of biodiversity, including taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions, we utilize advanced quantitative palaeoecological methods, data science, and machine learning. Our investigations cover diverse spatial scales, from local biomes to continents, enriched by the inclusion of long-term data, such as fossil pollen records and other ecological archives.\n\nState-of-the-Art Tools and Methods\nWe actively integrate cutting-edge tools and techniques into our research endeavors. Ranging from advanced quantitative statistical methods to state-of-the-art data science and machine learning applications, our toolkit is meticulously designed not only for analysis but also for the development of new methodologies. This design enables us to extract profound insights from intricate ecological datasets. By pioneering novel methods, we ensure that our research stays at the forefront of innovation, advancing the capabilities of contemporary ecological research and pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in understanding vegetation patterns.\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Approach\nOur work goes beyond traditional ecological boundaries, fostering an interdisciplinary approach. By synthesizing knowledge across disciplines such as macroecology, palaeoecology, biodiversity science, and quantitative ecology, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of vegetation dynamics and their drivers.\n\n\nOngoing projects\n\nBIODYNAMICS\nFOSSILPOL\nPPF Alpine\nHolocene Diversity Trends"

    "text": "Holocene Diversity Trends: Quantifying Global Vegetation Biodiversity Changes since the Last Glacial Maximum\nThis project aims to unveil macroecological patterns shaping global biodiversity, emphasizing the necessity of understanding historical developments for accurate forecasting. In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, comprehending drivers influencing biodiversity over time becomes crucial for mitigating human impacts on the environment.\nFocusing on long-living species, such as trees, requires a long-term perspective with data spanning millennia. Palaeoecological research, particularly fossil pollen records, serves as an exceptional source, offering detailed vegetation history over these extensive timescales. Leveraging cutting-edge advancements in quantitative palaeoecological methods, data science, and machine learning, the project will explore multiple facets of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) spanning various spatial scales (biomes, subcontinental, continents, global), encompassing the period since the Last Glacial Maximum.\nDespite existing regional studies on taxonomic diversity changes in past vegetation, a holistic global multi-faceted synthesis is lacking, hindering a holistic understanding of vegetation dynamics. Hence, taking advantage of the increasing availability of public data, the project aims to estimate vegetation changes globally.\nThe interdisciplinary nature of this work fosters a valuable resource for macroecologists, palaeoecologists, and ecoinformatics. By advancing comprehension of global biodiversity patterns and their historical drivers, this project contributes pivotal knowledge for predicting ecological responses to global change."
