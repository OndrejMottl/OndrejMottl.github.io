There are multiple built-in dissimilarity coefficients (dissimilarity_coefficient) for different types of assemblage data, and various levels of data smoothing that can be applied depending on the type and variance of the data. In addition, RRatepol can use randomisation, accompanied by use of age uncertainties of each level and taxon standardisation to detect RoC patterns in datasets with high data noise or variability (i.e. numerous rapid changes in composition or sedimentation rates).\n\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"HOPE-UIB-BIO/R-Ratepol-package\")\n\n\n\ncitation(package = \"RRatepol\")\nOndřej Mottl, John-Arvid Grytnes, Alistair W.R.

    "text": "Project description\nLife scientists need to be able to predict biodiversity and ecosystem alteration under global climate change. However, scenarios able to predict biodiversity trajectories are wishful thinking as biotic interactions in novel environments or among newly coexisting species are not sufficiently understood. The here proposed project – BIODYNAMICS – will use biotic interactions of vegetation to improve the capacity of predicting global biodiversity patterns. BIODYNAMICS will provide crucial insights into how local processes of species interactions shape continental and global biodiversity patterns during the last 20 thousand years (ka). BIODYNAMICS will develop innovative approaches that allow estimating ecosystem functioning, especially the essential biotic interactions, at 3 major ecological scales (spatial, temporal, and taxonomic), spanning from individual plants in local sites to whole continents and from 20 ka to the present. It will do so using a newly assembled publicly available multidisciplinary database integrating present and past global vegetation records with their functional traits and climate.\nA key aspect of BIODYNAMICS is to pursue future global biodiversity patterns, affected by anthropogenic climate change, with the understanding of the past, and to advance interdisciplinary cooperation between the scientific disciplines of eco-informatics, community ecology, climatology, and palaeo- and neo-ecology As a result, BIODYNAMICS will provide crucial insights into understanding and quantifying biotic interactions in the past and present, which would inform predictions about future ecological responses to global change. This is important to maintaining ecosystem services, which are key for our society."

It serves a multitude of essential purposes, such as defining global variables, loading functions, specifying file paths, and more. Every other file within a project should initiate with a reference to the configuration file (e.g., source(\"00_Config_file\")), as it aims to minimize repetition and establish an abstraction layer that allows for centralized changes. By declaring paths in the configuration file that are utilized across multiple scripts, the user can simply refer to them by their variable name in the scripts. This approach enables seamless modifications, including renaming variables or transitioning from down-sampled to full data. All you need to do is update the relevant path in one place, and the change will automatically propagate throughout your project."

The name of a header should start with a capital letter. Each header name should be followed by ----- so that it is automatically picked by IDE as a section header.\nEmpty lines should be placed before each header to separate chunks.\nHeadings can have various hierarchies:\n\n#----------------------------------------------------------#\n#--------------------------------------------------#\n#----------------------------------------#\n\nExample of a header:\n\n#----------------------------------------------------------#\n# Load data -----\n#----------------------------------------------------------#\n\nHeader names can be denoted by numbers, with subsections separated by *.*\nExample of a numbered header:\n\n#----------------------------------------------------------#\n# 1. Estimate diversity -----\n#----------------------------------------------------------#\n\n\n#--------------------------------------------------#\n# 1.1. Fit model -----\n#--------------------------------------------------#\n\n\n\nSingle-line comments\nAdding comments to code plays a pivotal role in ensuring reproducibility and preserving code knowledge for future reference. When things change or break, the user will be thankful for comments. There’s no need to comment excessively or unnecessarily, but a comment describing what a large or complex chunk of code does is always helpful. The first letter of a comment is capitalized and spaced away from the pound sign (#).\nExample of a single-line comment:\n\n# This is a comment.\n\n\n\nMulti-line comment\nMulti-line comments should start with a capital letter and the new line should start with one tab.\nExample of a multi-line comment:\n\n# This is a very long comment, where I need to describe\n#    what this code is doing\n\n\n\nInline comment\nInline comments should always start with a space.\nExample of inline comment:\n\nfunction(\n    agr = 1 # This is an example of an inline comment\n)\n\n\n\nCommenting functions\nFunction decoration should be placed before each function. See functions for details.\n\n\n\nCode width\nNo line of code should be longer than 80 characters (including comments). Users can visualise the 80 characters line in selected IDER"
