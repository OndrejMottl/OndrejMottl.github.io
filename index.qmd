::: {#hero-heading}

Hello, I'm Ondřej Mottl.

I am the head of the [Laboratory of Quantitative Ecology](/lab/about_the_lab.qmd) at [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html) in Prague, CZ. My research spans quantitative ecology, macroecology, palaeoecology, and community ecology, with a strong focus on data science. You can learn more about my ongoing work through my [projects](projects/index.qmd).

🔭 My current research focuses on developing advanced tools for analysing global biodiversity patterns and addressing challenges in scientific exploration.

🌱 I am deeply committed to teaching and mentoring, helping to inspire and guide the next generation of ecologists and data scientists. Learn more about my [teaching activities](teaching/teaching.qmd).

💡 In addition, I proudly serve as the [Open Science Champion](https://openscience.cuni.cz/OSCIEN-161.html) at Charles University, advocating for scientific reproducibility - a cause close to my heart.

💬 Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss R programming, GitHub, biodiversity patterns, or other topics of interest.
