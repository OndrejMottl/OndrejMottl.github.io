::: {#hero-heading}

Hello, I am Ondřej Mottl.

I am the head of the newly established Laboratory of Quantitative Ecology. My research primarily focuses on quantitative ecology, macroecology, palaeoecology, and community ecology, with a keen interest in data science.

🔭 My current efforts are dedicated to developing cutting-edge tools for studying global biodiversity patterns and breaking down barriers to scientific exploration.
