## Group Description

Welcome to the Laboratory of Quantitative Ecology, where we are dedicated to unraveling the complexities of vegetation dynamics. Our research spans spatio-temporal scales, investigating both historical and contemporary factors that shape ecological patterns of ecosystems.

### Research Focus

Delving into various facets of biodiversity, including taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions, we utilize advanced quantitative palaeoecological methods, data science, and machine learning. Our investigations cover diverse spatial scales, from local biomes to continents, enriched by the inclusion of long-term data, such as fossil pollen records and other ecological archives.

#### State-of-the-Art Tools and Methods

We use cutting-edge quantitative and statistical methods, alongside state-of-the-art data science and machine learning approaches. Our research not only involves the application of existing methods but also the development of new methodologies to extract deeper insights from complex ecological datasets. This continuous innovation ensures that our research remains at the forefront of ecological science, expanding the limits of our understanding of vegetation patterns.

#### Interdisciplinary Approach

Our research integrates concepts and methodologies from various fields, including macroecology, palaeoecology, biodiversity science, and quantitative ecology. This interdisciplinary perspective allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of vegetation dynamics and their underlying drivers.
