# Exploring the Past, Shaping the Future: A full-time PhD position in Global Vegetation Biodiversity (Prague, 4 years, starting October 2024)

Are you passionate about unraveling the mysteries of our planet's biodiversity using large data and statistic? I offer a fully funded, full-time PhD position in a field spanning macroecology, palaeoecology, biodiversity science, and quantitative ecology. The candidate will join my newly established [Laboratory of Quantitative Ecology](/lab/about_the_lab.qmd) at the [Department of Botany](https://www.natur.cuni.cz/biology/botany ) at the [Faculty of Sciences](https://www.natur.cuni.cz/eng), [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/uken-1.html) in Prague, Czech Republic.

## About the team 
My lab is at the forefront of macroecology, palaeoecology, and biodiversity science. I focus on exploring spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation biodiversity, with a commitment to interdisciplinary research and a focus on human-impact.

# Project in detail   

**Holocene Diversity Trends: Quantifying Global Vegetation Biodiversity Changes since the Last Glacial Maximum** 

This project aims to unveil macroecological patterns shaping global biodiversity, emphasizing the necessity of understanding historical developments for accurate forecasting. In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, comprehending drivers influencing biodiversity over time becomes crucial for mitigating human impacts on the environment.

Focusing on long-living species, such as trees, requires a long-term perspective with data spanning millennia. Palaeoecological research, particularly fossil pollen records, serves as an exceptional source, offering detailed vegetation history over these extensive timescales. Leveraging cutting-edge advancements in quantitative palaeoecological methods, data science, and machine learning, the project will explore multiple facets of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) spanning various spatial scales (biomes, subcontinental, continents, global), encompassing the period since the Last Glacial Maximum.

Despite existing regional studies on taxonomic diversity changes in past vegetation, a holistic global multi-faceted synthesis is lacking, hindering a holistic understanding of vegetation dynamics. Hence, taking advantage of the increasing availability of public data, the project aims to estimate vegetation changes globally.

The interdisciplinary nature of this work fosters a valuable resource for macroecologists, palaeoecologists, and ecoinformatics. By advancing comprehension of global biodiversity patterns and their historical drivers, this project contributes pivotal knowledge for predicting ecological responses to global change.
