# Exploring the Past, Shaping the Future: A full-time PhD position in Functional Vegetation Paleoecology (Prague, 4 years, starting October 2025)

Are you passionate about understanding ecosystem changes using large datasets and advanced modelling techniques? I offer a fully funded, full-time PhD position as part of the [Functional Vegetation Paleoecology project](https://ondrejmottl.github.io/projects/FunctionalVegetationPaleoecology/), funded by [PRIMUS](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-558.html), spanning paleoecology, quantitative ecology, and functional ecology. The candidate will join my [Laboratory of Quantitative Ecology](https://bit.ly/CU_QuantitativeEcology) at the [Department of Botany](https://natur.cuni.cz/en/biology/departments-and-work-places/department-of-botany), [Faculty of Science, Charles University](https://natur.cuni.cz/en) in Prague, Czech Republic.

# About the team

The [Laboratory of Quantitative Ecology](https://bit.ly/CU_QuantitativeEcology), led by [Ond≈ôej Mottl](https://ondrejmottl.github.io/), is dedicated to advancing quantitative ecology, macroecology, palaeoecology, and community ecology, with a particular focus on data science. Our research integrates global ecological datasets, functional ecology, and interdisciplinary approaches to address pressing challenges in biodiversity conservation, climate change, and human impacts on ecosystems. We are committed to open science, ensuring our work is accessible and reproducible, and we aim to foster an inclusive and collaborative environment that inspires and supports the next generation of ecologists and data scientists.

# Project in Detail

**Functional Vegetation Paleoecology: Mitigate the impact of climate change with data-driven insight from past vegetation**

Anticipating ecosystem changes under global climate change presents a complex challenge that demands interdisciplinary solutions. This project aims to leverage paleoecological vegetation data and functional ecology methods to estimate spatio-temporal variations of functional ecosystem properties beyond the point of human observation, thereby gaining an unprecedented understanding of global vegetation patterns.

The PhD project will focus on integrating global fossil pollen data with modern plant traits to explain ecosystem resilience and vulnerability to past climatic changes. By developing advanced models, this research will address taxonomic uncertainties and provide insights into regions most at risk under future climate scenarios, with a specific focus on assessing ecosystem stability in relation to [Planetary Boundaries project](https://ondrejmottl.github.io/projects/PlanetaryBoundaries/). Leveraging cutting-edge advancements in quantitative paleoecological methods and data science, the project will explore ecosystem functionality since the Last Glacial Maximum, spanning various spatial scales from biomes to global.

Through interdisciplinary research, the project aims to push the boundaries of our understanding of historical ecosystem dynamics and contribute essential insights into mitigating the impacts of anthropogenic climate change.
