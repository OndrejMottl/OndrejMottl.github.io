# VegVault in Scientific Data!

I'm delighted to share that our VegVault paper has been officially published in Scientific Data! 🎉

The paper "*VegVault dataset: linking global paleo-, and neo-vegetation data with functional traits and abiotic drivers*" is now available in peer-reviewed form.

# What is VegVault?

VegVault is an interdisciplinary SQL database that bridges the gap between paleo- and neo-ecological plot-based vegetation data, species functional traits, and abiotic information including climate and soil data. This resource is designed to facilitate large-scale analyses of vegetation dynamics across space and time.
