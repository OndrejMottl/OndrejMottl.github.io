::: {#hero-heading}
The goal of the **FOSSILPOL** project is to process multiple fossil pollen records to create a comprehensive, standardised dataset compilation, ready for multi-record and multi-proxy analyses at various spatial and temporal scales.

Learn more about the project on the [project websites](https://hope-uib-bio.github.io/FOSSILPOL-website/).

## My role
I am the lead developer of the project and joined first-author of the associated publication ["*A guide to the processing and standardisation of global palaeoecological data for large-scale syntheses using fossil pollen*"](/about_me/list_of_publications.qmd).
