::: {#heading}
**Planetary Boundaries and Safe Operating Spaces** is a working group within [Past Global Changes - PAGES](https://pastglobalchanges.org/about/general-overview), aiming to link palaeoecology with planetary boundaries to define variability and changes over decades to millennia.

## Project Description
To guide us towards sustainable futures, this working group explores how past ecological data can help define safe operating spaces for critical Earth system processes. By studying long-term data on land use, biosphere integrity, freshwater, and biochemical flows, we aim to model changes and identify potential tipping points.

This approach provides insights into stabilising Earth system processes by aiming for "Holocene-like" conditions, essential in mitigating ongoing environmental crises.

## My Role
As a committee member, I contribute expertise in palaeoecology and long-term data analysis, helping to develop and coordinate the project.
